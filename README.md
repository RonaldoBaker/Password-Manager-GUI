# Password-Manager-GUI

## Overview
This is a password manager GUI developed as part of self-led learning in Python. All applications made before this one were console-based. 

In this password manager the user can input their email/username and passwords to save to a simple text file. They can also generate a new password if they cannot think of one themselves, which automatically copies to the clipboard to paste into whichever application they choose.

## Further Improvements To Be Made
1. Save to csv or json file instead of a simple text file
2. Add search functionality that finds all results that are exact or closely related
3. Use ttk module to create more modern look
4. Create web browser widget to access passwords/access compact version of the application
